Tips for Mastering Boxed Mac and Cheese
 
Ingredients:
    -Boxed Mac and Cheese of choice (I chose Goodles-Shella Good)
        Inside should be the noodles and cheese packet
    -About 6 cups of water-Depends on box choice
    -1/4 cup of milk-Changes with choice of mac and cheese
    -1 tbsp of stick butter-Changes with choice of mac and cheese
    -Seasonings of choice-I like using pepper. 

1.Add 6 cups of water to a pot and set on med/high heat.
2.While waiting for water to boil, gather your ingredients (milk, butter, mac and cheese box, etc.)
3.It's time to add your noodles once you see many bubbles rising in your water. 
4.Add your noodles and set a timer (should say on the back of the box how long it should take, for mine it takes 11 minutes)
5.Stir every few minutes to keep the noodles from sticking together or to the pot. 
6.Once your timer goes off check your noodles
    -You can test this by taking out one noodle and making sure its doubled in size and by cutting it will the edge of a fork. If it is easily cuttable but not mushy your noodles should be good to go. 
7.Dump your noodles into a strainer and let them strain while you do the next few steps. 
8.In your pot add the butter and allow it to melt all the way or half way.
    -I like to do about half way so the noodles melt it the rest of the way. 
9.Add your milk and slightly stir together. This will mix your melted butter and milk. 
10.Shake out any excess water from your noodles and add them to the pot. 
11.Stir up contents so the noodles are covered in the butter and milk mix. 
12.Add your cheese mix and mix until creamy.
13.Add any seasonings you'd like. I like to add some pepper to my mac and cheese.
14.Serve it up and enjoy.
