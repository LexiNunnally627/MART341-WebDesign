Divs: I used divs to seperate all the dogs introduction pages. The three sections are Vader, Solo, and Obi. Also used on Vaders solo page to break up sections of the page (header, gallery, and contact)
Span: Used some to help identify specific sections of text. Currently used in the quote and to highlight the dogs names at the top of the home page. Also used some to isolate the alignment for my files (audio, video, iframe, etc.)
Audio: In Vaders solo page, I have audio of him barking.
Video: Videos of Vader on his solo page. 
IFrame: Linked each dogs instagram page.
Class: I created one to center all my divs on the page. The second one was specify characteristics in sections of text. They are mainly used inside of spans. The next one I created, helped align my different file types (audio, video, iframe, etc.)
Escape Character: Added quotation marks to my quote at the top of the page.
