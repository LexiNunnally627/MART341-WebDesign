# Starting to Code with *Markdown*

I'm really enjoying this semester so far. I love all of my classes, and I'm having fun in all of them. Creating a website was my favorite part of Creative Coding, so I'm excited to build my own website and learn how to make it engaging.

## Here is a list of some of things we've learned so far:

-Using the language **Markdown**.
-How the internet works.
-The best way to organize files.
-Using **Visual Studio Code**.
-Using **Github**.
