For this project, I expanded on my dog blog. I focused on Solo's page (solo.html) to create a new layout.


Complete six of the following:
Sizing – DONE: Sizing is controlled for images, videos, and iframes.
Border, Margin, and Padding- DONE: All used in navigation element. 
Margins - DONE: Also used to move images and videos away from the edge of the screen. 
Display: Inline / Inline-block – DONE: All content for the images and videos are in blocks.
Position – DONE: All positions are controlled by different classes.
