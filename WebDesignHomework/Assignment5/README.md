The best class I've ever taken (so far), was my first animation class, Intro to Animation. For as long as I could remember, I've always loved animation and film making, so finally taking a class on a subject I adored was very special for me. It is a small step towards what I want to do for the rest of my life. Also during my Disney College Program, I took a class on storytelling and how to create an effective tale using Disney's methods. They kept the class fun, entertaining, educational and funny for all the areas they talked about, from the Pixar formula, basic story structure, stories told through interactivity, and stories told in theme parks.
