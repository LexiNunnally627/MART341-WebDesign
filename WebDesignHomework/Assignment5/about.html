        <h1>Why These Sites</h1>
        <p>Now why did I choose to focus on these types of sites?</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Blog</h3>
        <p>Again, I started exploring website creation by making my own blog.
        I'd love to create another one on something random. Maybe a place where
        people could share the stories of their pets. I love seeing and sharing
        the messages of love and companionship between people and animals. It's 
        very uplifting to see the stories from all around the world. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
        <p>I really need a space to display all the artwork I'm proud of. At the 
        moment there are probably four websites I've created with my projects 
        on them. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Small Business</h3>
        <p>This type of site is one I should get good at. It would be good to get 
        practice at them early, so hopefully I'll be able to create websites for a living
        while I work towards my dream job.
