        <h1>Exploring Different Website Styles</h1>
        <p>Lexi Nunnally</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm so excited to create different types of websites.
        There are many kinds of sites I'd like to make; however these are
        my current top 3. </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Blog</h3>
        <p>I've always loved creating entertaining pieces of work. 
        The very first blog I made was a pov of my pet guinea pigs.
        It told the stories of their real and fake adventures. 
        This didn't last very long but it was fun while I did it. I 
        want to keep a playful and down to earth tone with any blogs I create. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
        <p>The website I've created the most throughout school
        is portfolios. In most of my art classes in high school and early 
        college classes I've had to create a portfolio for the work done in the class. 
        It would be nice to have one site for all the work I've created, instead
        of a ton of different websites for each of my classes. Plus I can show my personal 
        projects as well. While I still want to have a playful tone, I would want this site to be
        a bit more professional, while still having fun.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Small Business</h3>
        <p>The final type of site I'd like to do is one for a small business.
        This is the one type I haven't explored yet. Throughout my graphic design
        classes I got to make multiple branding packages and/or app designs for them;
        however, I really want to be able to code these projects into reality. This type
        of site would be strictly professional, and depending on the brand, maybe make it 
        more entertaining.
